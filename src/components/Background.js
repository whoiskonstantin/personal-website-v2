          I graduated from
          <span className='bold'> John Cabot University in Rome, Italy </span>
          with BA degree in Business Administration focusing on Finance and
          Economics in 2015. Since then I have pursued a career in marketing,
          sales and management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016 I started to work as a business development manager in a
          telecommunication startup â€“
          <span className='bold'> BNESIM in Dubai</span>. In 2017 I moved to
          Bulgaria where I have worked as a restaurant manager, started my own
          business and did
          <span className='bold'> web service freelancing</span>. Freelance work
          in the field of web development helped me realize that the most
          exciting part of all my previous professions was{' '}
          <span className='bold'>
            crafting admirable user interfaces and landing pages
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Since moving to the United States in 2019 I continued to sharpen my
          coding skills to prepare myself to join you on your next big project!
